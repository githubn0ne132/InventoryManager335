Nexus Vault is a high-performance inventory and gear management suite engineered specifically for your custom 3.3.5a server. By utilizing the server's Omagad() bypass wrapper, it achieves seamless, non-manual automation for every major inventory task, giving you unparalleled control and efficiency.🎛️ Control Panel and InterfaceDedicated Configuration Frame: A single, intuitive, in-game frame (accessible via /nv or a minimap button) allows users to customize the addon's behavior without editing Lua code.Feature Toggles: Every major function (Auto-Selling, Transmog Swap, Deletion) includes an easy Enable/Disable toggle, allowing you to use as much or as little automation as desired.⚔️ Gear Comparison and EquippingThe addon provides intelligent, automated gear decisions based on sophisticated stat weighting, a core feature similar to classic tools like Pawn or WeightsWatcher.Customizable Stat Weights: Users can set and save character-specific stat weights (e.g., $1.0\text{ Strength}$, $0.8\text{ Critical Strike}$, $0.6\text{ Expertise}$) for any specialization, ensuring gear is scored precisely to maximize throughput.Auto-Equip Upgrade: Scans any looted or acquired item against your currently equipped gear. If the new item scores a higher total weighted value than your current piece, it will automatically equip the item using the secure bypass wrapper (Omagad), eliminating the "Are you sure?" confirmation and speeding up the gearing process.Transmog Automation Integration: This module works in conjunction with the Transmog Automation (below), ensuring the stat-weighted gear remains equipped after any brief transmog swap.1. ✨ Full Transmog AutomationOne-Click Appearance Learning: A single action initiates a rapid, silent sequence that uses the Omagad() wrapper to temporarily equip and unequip all unlearned items in your bags, registering their appearance with the server's custom transmog system.Smart Filter: Only attempts to equip items relevant to your class/armor type to maximize speed and minimize unnecessary swaps.2. 💰 Automated Selling & Item DestructionThe addon provides detailed, user-defined rules to handle unwanted items, ensuring bags are always clean based on your specifications.Customizable Deletion/Selling Rules: You can create rules based on multiple, simultaneous criteria:Quality Filter: Set minimum and maximum quality (e.g., sell/destroy all items of quality Poor (Gray) and Uncommon (Green)).Value Threshold: Set a minimum sell value in copper (e.g., sell any Green item with a vendor value less than 5 Gold).Instant Selling: When interacting with a vendor, all items matching your custom selling rules are instantly sold (Omagad enabled).Instant Destruction: Items that match your custom destruction rules (typically soulbound trash or non-vendor items) are instantly destroyed with a keybind/click, completely bypassing the confirmation dialogue (Omagad enabled).
